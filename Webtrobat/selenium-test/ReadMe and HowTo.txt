keep in mind:
ALWAYS save the single test cases

HowTo set up a test suite:
first use support/setenvironment
then use a test case
then either use another test case or a support function

support:
simple functions, which have directly nothing to do with the html pages
e.g.: set the test environment or use the back button

testcases:
simple test cases on a specific page

testsuites:
a package of test cases, which test a complete page
