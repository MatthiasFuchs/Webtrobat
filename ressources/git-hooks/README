commit-msg
----------
* checks that your commit message has a correct format
* works with git, git gui
* does not work with egit (egit sucks, avoid it like the pest ;) )

Install:
    Create a link to commit-msg, also named commit-msg and move that link
    to your .git/hooks directory of the git project
